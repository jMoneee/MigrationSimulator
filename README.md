# MigrationSimulator
The Migration Framework and Simulator is a combination of C# framework / library and Unity simulation tool used for studying basic migration patterns across the US.  Users interact with the Unity simulation tool by implementing political policies or adjusting values via sliders, buttons, etc., which will alter the values in the framework.  The user can then use the simulation interface to view different estimated population values for categories of people, such as regional differences, education levels, and more.
